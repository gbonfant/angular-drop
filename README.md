Simple client to Farmdrop's API

## Dependencies
The client is served by a thin sinatra server so Ruby 1.9+ is needed. Unit tests are run via karma so node/npm is needed for that as well.

## Bootstrapping
```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ npm install
```

## Starting the server
``$ rackup ``

## Running the tests
``$ karma start``
